                    There was a time when Gregory Futch loved to collect old bones and arrowheads near his home in Northeast Florida. Greg had a history of severe mental illness, often experienced psychotic episodes, and had struggled with opiate addiction. In his younger days, he had sometimes been in trouble with the law. He had also faced a lot of bad luck: A serious shoulder industry ended his work in construction, and a mobile home he lived in burned down, prompting him to move back in with his mother, Vicki. But by the beginning of 2018, Greg hadn’t been arrested for more than ten years. Vicki Futch, then close to 80, believed her 54-year-old son was finally on an upward trajectory, even managing to help care for her as she got older. “If I needed him, he would rise to the occasion,” she later told the Florida Times-Union.
                  </div>
                  </br>

                  <div>
                    Then, in late January of 2018, Greg lost touch with reality and became aggressive. Vicki said she was barely hurt when he hit her, but she texted a captain at the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office, who had earlier offered to help her get Greg admitted to the hospital for help.
                  </div>
                  </br>

                  <div>
                    Instead, according to the Times-Union account, a deputy arrived. Finding Greg incoherent, and learning that he had hit his mother, the deputy arrested him for battery and took him to the Putnam County Jail. A few days later, Vicki was told by a detective that “she couldn’t bail him out because she was the listed victim in the battery case.” She was also told she could not visit her son unless he used a computer at the jail to add her to his approved visiting list--something Greg was incapable of doing.
                  </div>
                  </br>

                  <div>
                    Two days after his arrest, Greg couldn’t stop vomiting, and was taken to the emergency room. Upon his release, a doctor wrote “any significant change in condition or worsening of symptoms should prompt an immediate return.”
                  </div>
                  </br>

                  <div>
                    According to records obtained by the Times-Union from the family’s attorney, for the next 17 days, Greg languished in jail--most of the time in solitary confinement--without proper medical or mental health treatment. He had difficulty breathing, couldn’t hold down food, and was dehydrated from vomiting so much. In the three weeks between his arrest and his death, his weight dropped from 154 to 100 pounds. When the jail’s doctor ordered a psychiatric evaluation, the psychiatrist determined he was “malingering” to get attention--a diagnosis common in jails and prisons, where patients’ truthfulness is often questioned.

                  </div>
                  </br>

                  <div>
                    Robert Cohen, a physician and expert in correctional health care hired by the Futch family, said Greg died of multi-organ failure due to severe malnutrition and dehydration, which could have been easily prevented. Cohen noted that the jail had “failed to obtain [his] past medical history and ascertain any current medical issues.”
                  </div>
                  </br>
                  <div>
                    In November 2018, the family filed a lawsuit in federal court in Florida for violation of Gregory Futch’s civil rights and of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The suit named as defendants the Management and Training Corporation, which is the private healthcare provider for the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office, and several of the company’s employees. It was settled for an undisclosed amount in July 2019.
                    Vicki still wishes she had never called the police. “I would never trust them again, but I trusted them,” she told the Times-Union. “I know that sounds stupid now.”
